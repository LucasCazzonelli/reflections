When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
If I want to collaborate on a repository with multiple people or if I want to access the code from different computers. 
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Maybe to reduce the amount of merging conflicts.
